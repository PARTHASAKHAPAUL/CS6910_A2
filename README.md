# CS6910_A2:::  **```Please see the partA and partB folder.```**
# There are separate files for respective READMEs of partA and partB in those folder. And the codes for PartA and PartB are also in those folder. Initially I forgot to make the 1st file name with suffix as partA so thats why I have made the separate files in the separate folders partA and partB. So please see the folders partA and partB. Corresponding Codes and Readme's are in the folders
